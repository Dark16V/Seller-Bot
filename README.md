# A bot for selling proxies and VPNs.

## My unfinished and unsuccessful project.

It uses the integration of two third-party APIs, a PostgreSQL database connection, and automatic backup creation. It also includes a Docker Compose setup, the asynchronous Aiogram framework, and logging. I tried to follow OOP principles throughout the project — that is, building it around classes.
This project cannot be run via Docker or a virtual environment; it’s only meant for viewing and analyzing the source code.
